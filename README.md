# ⚡️ React Arsenal

_My personal stash of React boilerplates—because I am sick of reinventing the wheel again, and again, and again._

### **📦 Available Libraries**

- **React Hook Form + Zod** – Scalable forms with type safety
- **Redux Toolkit** – Battle-tested global state management
- **Axios Instance** – Pre-configured API client

### **🚧 On the Radar** _(Next Up)_

- **TanStack Query** – Smoother server state
- **React Router** – Route like a pro

### **✨ How It Works**

1. Pick a library.
2. Go to page.
3. Steal the code.
4. Profit.
